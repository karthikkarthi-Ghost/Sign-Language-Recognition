## Introduction

This project aims to develop a system that can accurately recognize sign language gestures using advanced AI and ML algorithms. By capturing hand movements and converting them into text, this tool can help bridge the communication gap for individuals who rely on sign language.

## Features

- **Real-time Sign Language Recognition**: Recognizes sign language gestures in real-time using a webcam or video input.
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes state-of-the-art AI and ML models to ensure high accuracy in gesture recognition.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for users to interact with the system.
- **Extensible**: Designed to support the addition of new gestures and languages.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sign-Language-Recognition.git
   cd Sign-Language-Recognition
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Dataset**
   Follow the instructions in the [Dataset](#dataset) section to download and prepare the dataset.

4. **Train the Model**
   Train the model using the provided training scripts:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

## Usage

To use the Sign-Language-Recognition system, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   python run_app.py
   ```

2. **Interact with the System**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`. Use the interface to start the sign language recognition process.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of labeled sign language gestures. You can download the dataset from [this link](#) and extract it into the `data` directory.

## Model

The model is built using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to effectively capture the spatial and temporal features of sign language gestures.
